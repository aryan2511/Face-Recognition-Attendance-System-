# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System-
A simple project using Python on face recognition 
In this projet we will be using python open cv and xlwrite 

here open cv helps capture the faces of students 1 at a time 
it can be done roll no. wise 
and it is compared to the harr cascade and stored in a dataset folder 
the image is stored with the name user 1.1 1 represents roll no.1 and the no. after the . says the amount of images of the student 

from there it is trained and then later recognizes the face of the student
